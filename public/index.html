      <h1>Welcome to Appliance Energy Insights</h1>
      <p>This website provides comprehensive analysis of energy consumption data for household appliances, with a particular focus on televisions. Our research is based on the Australian Government's Energy Rating for Household Appliances dataset.</p>
      <p>Understanding energy efficiency is crucial for both consumers and retailers. By analyzing patterns in energy consumption, screen sizes, technologies, and brand offerings, we provide valuable insights that can help retailers make informed stocking decisions and help consumers choose more efficient appliances.</p>
      <p>Navigate to the <strong>Televisions</strong> section to explore detailed analysis of TV energy consumption patterns, including technology comparisons, brand analysis, and efficiency ratings.</p>

  <h1>Televisions & Energy</h1>
  <p>
    This section explores data from the Australian Government’s <em>Energy Rating for Household Appliances</em> dataset, focusing on televisions. 
    The goal is to provide insights for <strong>retailers</strong> to help decide which TV models to stock and how energy efficiency affects the market.
  </p>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>
    The analysis is most useful for TV retailers. By understanding which types of televisions are popular, 
    how brands differ in the number of models they offer, and how energy efficiency varies, retailers can 
    make smarter stocking decisions and reduce inventory costs.
  </p>

  <h2>Key Questions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>What type of TV technology (LCD, LED, OLED) do consumers most often buy?</li>
    <li>Which screen sizes are the most popular?</li>
    <li>Which brands offer the largest number of models?</li>
    <li>Which TV types consume the least amount of power?</li>
    <li>How does screen size relate to power consumption?</li>
    <li>What is the relationship between star ratings and screen size?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Findings</h2>

  <h3>TV Technology</h3>    <img src="../assets/images/tv-tech-piechart.png" alt="TV Technology Distribution">

  <p>
    LCD (LED) is by far the most common technology, followed by standard LCD and OLED. This suggests that LCD-based TVs dominate the market, while OLED is a niche but growing segment.
  </p>

  <h3>Screen Sizes</h3>    <img src="../assets/images/screen-size-histogram.png" alt="Screen Size Distribution">

  <p>
    Most televisions fall into mid-range sizes, particularly around 55, 60, and 65 inches. These sizes represent the most popular consumer choice.
  </p>

  <h3>Brands</h3>    <img src="../assets/images/brand-bar-chart.png" alt="Brand Model Counts">

  <p>
    Brands like Samsung and LG offer the widest range of models, giving them a strong market presence. 
    The more models a brand provides, the more likely they are to be picked by retailers and consumers.
  </p>

  <h3>Power Efficiency</h3>    <img src="../assets/images/power-efficiency-plot.png" alt="Power Efficiency by Tech">

  <p>
    Different technologies show differences in power efficiency, but not by a wide enough margin to be a strong selling point. 
    Instead, power use is more directly tied to screen size.
  </p>

  <h3>Screen Size and Power Consumption</h3>    <img src="../assets/images/screen-vs-power.png" alt="Screen Size vs Power Consumption">

  <p>
    Larger screen sizes almost always use more power. This shows screen size is the main driver of energy consumption, although technology and design also play a role.
  </p>

  <h3>Star Ratings</h3>    <img src="../assets/images/star-rating-vs-size.png" alt="Star Ratings vs Screen Size">

  <p>
    There is little correlation between star rating and screen size. Star ratings are designed to normalize for size, 
    so retailers should not assume smaller TVs automatically score better.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Overall, the dataset shows that TV retailers should focus on mid-sized LCD/LED models (55–65 inches), 
    particularly from brands with strong product variety like Samsung and LG. Power consumption increases with screen size, 
    but efficiency differences between technologies are relatively small. Star ratings provide an independent efficiency measure 
    and should be considered when promoting models to environmentally conscious customers.
